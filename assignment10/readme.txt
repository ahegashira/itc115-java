Building Java Programs, 4th Edition
Chapter 9, Exercises 5-6.

Implement a class called TICKET that will serve as the superclass for all three types of tickets. 
Define all common operations in this class, and specify all differing operations in such a way that 
every subclass must implement them. No actual objects of type TICKET will be created: Each actual ticket 
will be an object of a subclass type. Define the following operations:

>> The ability to construct a ticket by number.
>> The ability to ask for a tickets price.
>> THe ability to println a ticket object as a String.

Implement a class called WALKUPTICKET to represent a walk-up event ticket. Walkup tickets
are also constructed by number and they have a price of $50.
